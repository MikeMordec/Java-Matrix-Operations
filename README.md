# Java-Matrix-Operations

This Java program performs matrix addition and measures the performance of various operations including matrix creation, display, and addition. It provides insights into the execution time of each operation.

## Features

- Creates two matrices of user-defined size.
- Displays the created matrices.
- Adds the matrices together and displays the result.
- Measures the time taken for matrix creation, display, and addition.

## How to Use

## Example

Matrix Addition

Enter number of rows & columns
2
2
Enter the data for the first matrix (each element separated by space):
1 2
3 4
Enter the data for the second matrix (each element separated by space):
5 6
7 8

The First Matrix is :
1 2
3 4

The Second Matrix is :
5 6
7 8

The Sum is :
6 8
10 12

Time taken for matrix creation: 10 milliseconds
Time taken for matrix display: 5 milliseconds
Time taken for matrix addition: 3 milliseconds
